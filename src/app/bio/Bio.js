          <br/>As a child used to play outdoor riding bicycle, on rainy days LEGO instead (because build things is so awesome). Videogames wasn't THAT fun yet.<br/>
          <br/>As teenager used to play on PC or Nintendo64 with friends, it was soo cool... Some time after the taste for Rock and Metal<br/> 
          made us all willing to play instruments and start a band, and there my passion for <b>Music</b> began.<br/>
          <br/>College started so the new jobs. The band is dismissed cuz no one have that much "free" time with all <br/>
          new adult responsibilities. Yet alone and without free time I kept playing, recording, buying new instruments (until today).<br/>
          <br/>Adult life, income surplus and a new passion discovered, <b>Motorcycles</b>. Yeah, Rock'n'ride! \m/<br/>
          <br/>Willing to discover the world by living in a distinct place I acquired <b>Italian citizenship</b> by descent.<br/>
          <br/>To Do...
